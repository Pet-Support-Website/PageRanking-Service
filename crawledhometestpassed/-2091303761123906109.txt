A single cut or scratch on the shell can let in bacteria or fungus, which leads to severe rotting. Shell rot can cause immense pain in the tortoises if not treated fast. Even in some cases, the whole shell plate falls off from the structure exposing the cavities of the tortoise. Causes Apparently, the main reason for shell rot is the attack of bacteria or fungi. Tortoises can get damaged shells for many reasons. First, if the bacteria enter the shell by any chance, they quickly grow their population. Soon, they outgrow and start rotting the scute cells. In many cases, the bacterial attack spreads in the blood cells and bones. As a result, the disease gets more complex. A tortoise can get a scratch or crack on the shell in many ways. For example, •\tIn a fight •\tFalling from a height •\tAccident •\tFrom a sharp-edged item in the enclosure Besides, low humidity and improper temperature inside the habitat can also lead to flaky shell skins. Lack of moisture or dehydration causes cracks on the scutes. Moreover, a filthy habitat crawls with bacteria and fungi. Hence, the risk of shell rot increases by many degrees. Symptoms •\tBlack spots along the crack •\tUneven shell •\tDischarge coming out of the wound •\tFoul odor •\tPits falling off •\tLethargy •\tLoss of appetite Treatment & Prevention Home treatment is possible for initial stage shell rotting. But first, you have to identify the problem. Next, isolate the tortoise from the healthy ones as shell rot is highly contagious and infectious. Now, use a soft bristle brush to scrub the dirt from the wound. You can do the scrubbing when bathing the tortoise. After that, use a chlorohexidine or similar solution to kill the existing bacteria in the pit. Later, you can apply healing cream like silver sulfadiazine cream, Neosporin, or tribble antibiotic cream for a rapid recovery. Continuing this routine for a few weeks will heal the tortoise. However, you must take the tortoise to the vet if the shell rot takes a severe turn. For example, if foul discharge comes from the pits, the plates fall off, or the pet stops eating completely. The specialist will suggest medications and injections for healing. Besides, he will arrange a feeding tube to bring the tortoise back to a healthy state. As you can see, the tortoises suffer a lot because of shell rotting. Hence, you should really focus on the prevention of this disease. Some preventive measures are, •\tRemove anything with sharp edges from the habitat. •\tDo not place your tortoise on a height. •\tHold the tortoise with a solid grip while handling or transferring it. •\tFeed the tortoise right to boost its immunity. •\tMaintain a clean habitat. •\tThe humidity inside the enclosure should not be too low, and the temperature should be in a suitable range. •\tIf the tortoise gets a damaged shell, do a proper bandage so that the bacteria can not enter the system. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/tortoise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
