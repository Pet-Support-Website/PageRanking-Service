This excess fluid lead to visible swelling of the body in certain areas. Causes Edema is a disease condition which could be caused by lymphatic blockage and renal disease. A more common cause, however, is by the excess vitamins to your chameleon from crickets or other foods dusted with them. Also, too much humidity can be a major cause of edema. Signs Signs of this disease are usually easy to detect. Excessive swelling which closely resembles a goiter can occur in many visible areas including the chest, throat, and neck. Prevention and Treatment To prevent this condition, do not be tempted to feed your pet on food which is gut loaded with too many vitamins. When vitamins are too much, it does not always translate to better health. Also, foods very high on proteins should not be fed on a regular basis as it can lead to edema. Therefore, the key to the prevention of edema is a moderation in the supplements you feed it with. Another way to prevent this is to ensure that the home of your chameleon is not too humid.
