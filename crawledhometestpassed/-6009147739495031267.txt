MBD is more accurately a general term which describes a collection of medical disorders that affect the bones. For example, they could stem from Nutritional Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (NSHP, which is the most common), Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (RSHP), Hypertrophic Osteopathy (HO) and Osteoporosis. Causes This disease usually occurs when a chameleon is not adequately exposed to sufficient UVB. It can also be caused by a lack of dietary calcium and an imbalanced nutrition in general. Signs This condition is usually a slow process and as such, constant examination is important. Common signs of this disease are bowed legs, rubbery jaws, and clumsiness. With time, your chameleon may have some trouble with climbing, a loss of appetite, and difficulty in projecting the tongue to feed. If your chameleon fails to use its tongue at all, it is very important to quickly see a vet. Tongue problems not caused by physical damage are usually a sign of nutritional deficiency. Prevention and Treatment To avoid having to deal with MBD, make sure you gut load your insects with adequate vitamins and calcium. In addition, ensure that you provide sufficient water in the drip system and adequate UVB light. If you properly keep your chameleon, it should never have MBD.
