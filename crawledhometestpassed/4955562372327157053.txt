Feed an unlimited amount of grass hay each day, such as timothy, oat hay, or orchard grass; avoid alfalfa hay. You can simply pile the hay in the enclosure or put it in a special feeder called a hopper. Just make sure there's always some available. Supplement the hay with a variety of green leafy vegetables. Good choices include lettuce (except iceberg), herbs, watercress, carrot tops, cucumbers, and sprouts. Provide a more limited supply of other vegetables and fruits. Check with your vet on the quantity to feed and to be sure all items you offer are rabbit-safe. You can offer fresh food once or twice a day, simply placing them in the enclosure near your rabbit. Remove any uneaten fresh food after a few hours to prevent spoilage. You also can offer a limited amount of commercial rabbit pellets. However, overfeeding pellets can cause digestive issues and obesity.4 So be sure to discuss the feeding amount with your vet. Place a day's worth of pellets in a ceramic bowl. Discard any leftover pellets before feeding the next day's portion. Finally, rabbits should always have access to fresh water. Use either a ceramic dish or water bottle attached to the side of the enclosure (make sure your rabbit knows how to drink from the bottle), refreshing the water daily.
