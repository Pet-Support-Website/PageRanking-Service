Hence, talk to a vet immediately if you notice abnormal shell or bone growth. He will prescribe meds and lifestyle changes which you should implement properly. For example, lifestyle and food habit changes. Set up a quality UV light if you raise your tortoise in captivity. Without UVB exposure, this creature can not accelerate vitamin D production or absorption of calcium. Again, feed the tortoises a balanced diet filled with grass, hay, and greens. Besides, add calcium and vitamin D supplements to the diet to back up the deficiencies. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/tortoise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
