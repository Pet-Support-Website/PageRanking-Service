Wild-caught specimens are usually extremely stressed, carry a heavy parasite load, and have difficulty acclimating to captive conditions. Chameleons are not the hardiest nor easiest reptiles to keep, and starting with a stressed pet will only make matters worse. In addition, the capture and shipping of chameleons (which fortunately is being more tightly regulated) results in the deaths of many animals. Many more die in transit than make it to the pet store. Once you've found a captive bred chameleon, observe them. They should be bright and active, able to change colors, and have a well-fleshed body. The Different Types of Chameleons Different Species of Chameleon There are several species of chameleons that are popular as pets. Here are a few options to consider: •Veiled chameleon •Jackson's chameleon •Panther chameleon FAQ •How much do pet chameleons cost? Depending on where you live, chameleons can cost from $30 to $300. •Where do chameleons like to be pet? Most chameleons don't enjoy being pet, but you can try some gentle rubbing under your chameleon's chin and see if it enjoys that. •When pet chameleons color change, are they stressed? Yes, they get darker when they are stressed, and appear lighter and brighter when they are calmer or excited. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/chameleon", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general"]}
