Crickets, mealworms, super worms, wax worms, wax moths, and roaches are all good items to feed. Prey food should be gut loaded with calcium prior to feeding and should be dusted with a calcium supplement.2 Some nutritious leafy greens (avoid spinach, lettuce, and cabbage) and other vegetables and fruits can be offered in small amounts as chameleons will occasionally eat these.
