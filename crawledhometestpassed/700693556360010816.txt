Primary gout occurs when a chameleon is fed with too much protein, while a secondary gout is caused by another medical condition. Kidney failure is a major cause of gout in chameleon (secondary gout). Kidney failure is a common cause of death in pet chameleons and in the long run, can lead to other debilitating conditions such as gout which is usually characterized by a painful swelling of the leg joints. Gout is a very complicated condition with a variety of signs and needs to be handled by a vet. Causes Kidney failure usually occurs when a chameleon is subjected to long-term dehydration or long-term use of certain veterinarian-prescribed antibiotics. Gout ensues when excess amounts of uric acid are produced in the blood. These uric acids usually flow in the bloodstream and get stuck at some capillaries and thereby cause swelling and pain. Signs Common signs include reduced mobility, swellings at joints, excessive drinking, loss of appetite, and extreme aggression especially when the joints are touched. Your chameleon may also show signs of pain when walking, climbing, and may be seen stand on three legs instead of four (will usually not stand on one of its hind legs). Prevention Kidney stones and gout are usually caused by low-level dehydration which may not be easily detected. To prevent this, maintain appropriate humidity in the enclosure (between 50-70%) and make sure the drip system is functioning well so as to ensure adequate humidity levels. Also, since the chameleon is a low protein animal, avoid feeding it with lots of protein. Feed it instead with lots of fruits and vegetables and ensure it drinks sufficient water always. Treatment The vet should be in charge of treating this condition. Treatment options include the prescription of medicines which will dissolve the uric acid crystals or an actual operation on the chameleon to remove the uric acid crystals. You may have to force your chameleon to drink more water if it refuses to drink.
