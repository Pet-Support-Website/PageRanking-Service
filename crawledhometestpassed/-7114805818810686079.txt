They're also prone to mouth rot, or stomatitis,3 an infection around the mouth that shows redness and excess saliva or drooling. Another common ailment among chameleons is metabolic bone disease.1 This condition, which can be fatal if not treated appropriately, causes a chameleon's bones to become spongy.
