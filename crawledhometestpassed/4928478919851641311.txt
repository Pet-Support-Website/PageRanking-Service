This is a common condition in captive reptiles and is most often caused by bacteria but may also be due to viruses, fungal infections, or parasites. Causes Respiratory infections are often the result of poor husbandry. Snakes can easily fall ill if they are kept in unsanitary conditions or if the temperature and humidity levels in their enclosure do not mimic their natural environment. There are many different species of snake in the pet trade, so it’s important to understand their husbandry needs to prevent any negative health conditions that can easily result from improper care. Diagnosis A veterinarian will perform a physical examination and go over the clinical signs the snake is exhibiting. Depending on how severe the infection is, diagnostics may include X-rays, blood work, fecal tests, and even a culture from the respiratory tract may be obtained to determine the exact microorganism involved. Treatment Respiratory infections must be treated with antibiotics that may be given by mouth, injection, or through inhalation. If it has been determined that either parasites or fungi are involved, other medications will also be included. Respiratory infections can easily reoccur if the underlying reason for the infection is not solved. In most cases, it will involve the owner doing a thorough cleaning of the environment and taking proper steps to ensure the snake’s enclosure is kept clean and at the proper temperature gradient and humidity levels. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/snake", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
