They live in lakes, ponds, and streams with muddy bottoms and minimal flow. It is found in both temperate and tropical areas and prefers water temperatures above 70°F. It is most active in the dimly-hit hours at dusk and dawn but will swim and forage during all hours of the day. Replicating these conditions in your pond is not a difficult task. Koi Fishpond Setup Your garden pond should maintain temperatures between 74-86°F all year round. In the winter, a heating system will be needed to prevent any freezing. Water flow is not necessary, but the fish will be just fine if you choose to add a small stream or waterfall to your pond. The pH of your pond should be kept between 6-9. You can use crushed limestone in your water can help to maintain your pH. Your pond should be made from concrete, with a rubber lining and muddy bottom substrate. The very best setup for Koi is a beautiful outdoor water garden, complete with non-invasive plants that will not damage your natural ecosystem. The best plants for a water garden includes: \twater hyacinth \twater lilies \tcattails \tpickerels \tfloating pondweed \tduckweed, and more Many keepers plant willows and other shady, trailing trees around their water garden. This helps to provide extra shade and cover for your fish. What Size Pond Do Koi Need? Koi need at least 250 gallons of water. A school of large Koi will require up to 1,000 gallons. Your pond should have a minimum depth of at least 6 feet and include both shallow and deeper areas. The rule of thumb with these fish is to keep 10 gallons of water for every inch of fully grown Koi. This means 250 gallons of water for one adult fish. Are Koi Suitable For Your Pond? There is a reason that Koi fish are one of the most popular choices for garden ponds. They are a lovely addition to an outdoor pond and are not as difficult to care for as other large pond fish. They are a favorite of fish keepers and gardeners alike and provide the perfect addition to any water garden. With so many beautiful colors to choose from, you can be sure to find just the right fish for your garden. Beginner fish keepers should start off with the more common Koi varieties before attempting to take on more expensive breeds.
