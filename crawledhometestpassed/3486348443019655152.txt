This is often referred to as a stuck shed in the reptile community. Healthy snakes will shed their entire epidermis at once, unlike other reptiles like lizards that shed in pieces. If a snake is unable to shed the entire skin at once, there is something amiss. Signs of Dysecdysis •Pieces of shed skin stuck to the body •Unshed eye caps •Unshed tail Causes Incomplete shedding is a sign there is an underlying problem. Most often this is due to poor husbandry for the specific species. Having temperatures and humidity levels outside of the snake’s natural range can easily cause issues with shedding. Inadequate nutrition, handling the snake during a shed, parasites, bacterial infections, and a lack of furnishings in the terrarium to assist in the shedding process can also contribute to dysecdysis. Diagnosis It’s easy to identify an incomplete shed by observing the snake. When a snake sheds healthily, there will be no leftover skin anywhere on the body and you will notice an entire piece of skin in the shape of your snake within the enclosure. An incomplete may slough off in pieces and some old skin may be left behind anywhere on the body, especially around the eyes and at the tip of the tail. Treatment An incomplete shed can typically be handled at home by soaking the snake in warm water or by wrapping them in a damp towel. You should never try to peel the skin off, as it can damage the new skin and cause the snake significant injury. Any time you are concerned about the leftover shed, reach out to your veterinarian for further guidance and assistance. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/snake", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
