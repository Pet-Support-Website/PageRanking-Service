Dehydration is the most common condition that plague chameleons and is in fact, the most common cause of death in pet chameleons. Causes Dehydration is caused by inadequate water supply. It occurs when there is insufficient drinking water, or when the enclosure is not humid enough. However, if your water supply, misting system, and humidity level are just perfect, you may need to contact a certified vet as there may be some underlying disease condition. Signs Common signs to look out for are sunken eyes, folding skin, dry feces, yellow/orange urate, loss of appetite, and lethargy. These signs suggest the immediate need for a better misting system or water supply. Prevention Prevention is by the use of good misting systems and adequate supply of water to the chameleon. Also, the level of humidity must be adequate and well maintained. Treatment If you notice the signs of dehydration early enough, you can solve the problem by prolonging the misting periods. It is also beneficial if you allow the leaves in its enclosure collect water. Another alternative is to provide your chameleon its drinking water via a dropper. This way, you can be sure your chameleon drinks adequate water. The more intense the dehydration, the more water is needed for rehydration.
