The initiation of this condition starts with a simple cut or minor wound inside the mouth of the tortoises. However, a bacterial attack can occur if the injury goes unprotected, leading to an infection or rot. But yes, this problem is not always associated with a cavity injury. Sometimes, tortoises suffer from stomatitis if they have a weak immune system. When the immunity of the tortoise is compromised, the harmful bacteria in the mouth dominate and cause inflammation. Thus, the creature experiences mouth rot. Causes Basically, the bacterial attack in the oral cavity or the overpopulation of bad bacteria is responsible for stomatitis in tortoises. Sometimes, these creatures suffer from mouth rot after coming out of hibernation. Hibernation or brumation is a natural part of the tortoises’ life. During the severe cold, these reptiles slow down their metabolism and go for months-long-sleeps. In those months, they do not eat or participate in regular activities. The immunity of the tortoises takes a low blow because of staying away from food and a normal lifestyle. Thus these creatures become more prone to infectious diseases like stomatitis.
