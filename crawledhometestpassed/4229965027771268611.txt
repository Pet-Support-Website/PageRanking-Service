This is a painful condition that comes about due to a bacterial infection within the soft tissue in the mouth. If left untreated it may even spread into the bone. The most common bacteria associated with infectious stomatitis include but are not limited to pseudomonas, aeromonas, klebsiella, and salmonella. Signs of Stomatitis •Lack of appetite •Excessive salivation •Discharge or bleeding of the mouth •Mucous or pus in or around the mouth •Red, inflamed tissue •Lesions in the oral cavity •Open mouth breathing Causes Snakes can develop mouth rot for several reasons. Most often, it is due to a suppressed immune system being unable to properly fight off the isolated bacteria in question. Suppressed immunity can be the result of stress due to improper temperature and/or humidity, an unsanitary environment, inadequate nutrition, or even underlying disease. This can also happen as a result of trauma to the mouth. Diagnosis Diagnosis of infectious stomatitis is done through a physical examination by a licensed veterinarian. They may even collect a sample of affected tissue to obtain a bacterial culture and find the specific culprit. Treatment Prompt treatment is very important considering this is a painful condition that can become more severe and lead to further problems. Treatment typically involves either oral or injectable antibiotics and proper cleaning of the affected area with antiseptics. The underlying cause of the condition will also need to be addressed to prevent reoccurrence. Occasionally, infectious stomatitis may be so severe that surgical removal of dead tissue may be necessary. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/snake", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
