Both turtles and tortoises get infected with this infectious disease. It is not a seasonal disease and is primarily seen in tortoises that have recently hibernated or bromated. Symptoms •\tNasal discharge •\tDischarge from eyes •\tSwollen eyes •\tLoss of appetite •\tWeight loss •\tFatigue •\tClogged nose •\tEnlarged and distorted snout in babies •\tSwollen joint •\tTrouble breathing Treatment Most tortoise keepers are not familiar with the mycoplasma infection. As a result, they can not recognize the disease sooner. However, generally, it takes a week or two for the signs to come to the surface after the bacterial attack. Mycoplasma infection can be deadly for tortoises. It is highly contagious and can sicken other pets within a few days. If you suspect mycoplasma in your tortoise, take it to a vet. The specialist will run some tests to diagnose the disease. Then he will prescribe long-term antibiotics and solutions to flush away the discharges. It takes months for the sick tortoise to return to a healthy life. Also, there is a high chance that the pet can get attacked by mycoplasma bacteria again. Hence, you should make appointments with the vet for a follow-up. Mycoplasma infection can mess up the tortoises’ feeding habits, leading to severe weight loss. If the tortoise declines food constantly, feeding the pet with a tube can help. Besides, it is mandatory to focus on the housing of the tortoises. A dirty enclosure often invites harmful bacteria. So, the keepers must keep an eye on the cleanliness. Moreover, ensure proper lighting and temperature range inside the terrarium to fasten the healing process. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/tortoise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
