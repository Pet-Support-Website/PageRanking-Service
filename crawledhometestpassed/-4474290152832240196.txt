Scale rot may also be used to describe burns, abscesses, and any secondary bacterial infections associated with the skin. Signs of the conditions that fall under this term are easily observed and if possible, best treated in the early stages to prevent open sores, blisters, and ulcerations. Signs of Scale Rot •Skin or scales appear cracked and crusty •Swollen scales •Red, brown, or discolored skin •Lack of appetite •Sores, ulcerations, or blisters on the scales Causes The most common cause of scale rot is poor husbandry. This includes unsanitary living conditions or improper temperature and/or humidity levels. Poor nutrition may also be associated but is much less common. While skin conditions appear to be surface level, it is important to figure out what the root cause of the problem is so that it can be solved and prevented from happening again. Diagnosis If scale rot is suspected, the snake should be evaluated by a veterinarian. They will go over the snake’s medical history and clinical signs and will likely ask you about your care practices. It is important to have the condition diagnosed as quickly as possible to prevent the condition from becoming worse and leading to a more severe infection. Treatment Treatment often includes the use of either oral or injectable antibiotics. Sedation may be necessary in more severe cases to properly clean the affected area and remove any dead tissue as needed. Proper treatment will also include correcting the root cause of the problem. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/snake", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
