This condition could be very serious and life threatening. Causes This condition occurs when the heat lamp is kept inside the enclosure or too close to the top of the cage. These locations give a chameleon direct access to the heat source and they tend to get real close. However, unlike humans, chameleons don’t have suitable skin sensation to enable them to get away quickly from extreme heat. Because of this insensitivity, chameleons are susceptible to thermal burns. Signs Common signs to look out for are gray/black blisters and/or necrotic tissue on the skin, infection, lethargy, closing one or both eyes. Prevention Minimize the chance of your chameleon getting too close to the heat source by not keeping it too close to the enclosure. Also, do not allow the heat bulb to touch the mesh on the topside. You should also avoid the use of high wattage bulbs when not necessary. Maintain a correct ambient and basking temperature. Treatment If burns have already occurred, it is best to consult the vet on what treatment options are available or on what care you have to give. It may take a long period of time before the burn scars finally erase, so you need to be patient with the healing process. Topical ointments such as Silvadene cream and sterile dressing can be applied. Also, put in mind that you should allow the scab to fall off on its own.
