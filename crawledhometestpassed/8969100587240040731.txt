{"url": "http://localhost:3000/article/89", "title": "Inclusion Body Disease in Snake(IBD)", "text": "Inclusion Body Disease in Snake(IBD) PetKeen #reptile #snake #diseases Inclusion body disease is a severe, fatal viral disease that is transmitted easily among captive snakes. It affects snakes in the Boidae family, which are various species of pythons and boas. When infected, pythons will often show signs quickly, while boas may carry the virus for up to a year or more without showing any indication. Signs of IBD •Lack of appetite •Weight loss •Abnormal gaze •Loss or coordination •Disorientation •Inability to strike or constrict •Inability to move normally •Paralysis Causes While inclusion body disease is easily transmitted, experts do not yet understand exactly how transmission works, other than that it’s easily passed from snake to snake. The exact cause of the disease is also unknown, though there is substantial evidence that it is related to an unusual arenavirus. There is still much more to be learned about IBD. Diagnosis If IBD is suspected, the veterinarian will do a thorough physical examination and go over the signs the snake is exhibiting. Blood tests and X-rays may be performed and up until recently, this disease could only be diagnosed under a microscope by observing the inclusion bodies within the blood cells, but there is now a PCR test available. Treatment There is currently no treatment for inclusion body disease and the affected snake will ultimately die. Humane euthanasia is often recommended, as the symptoms only worsen, and the snake will be unable to eat and will lose motor function. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/snake", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
