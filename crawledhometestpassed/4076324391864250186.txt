Select a small litter box with short walls and fill it with a different bedding from what you use in the rest of the cage. Also, it can be helpful to add some soiled bedding. Place the litter box in a spot where your guinea pig tends to relieve itself and treat it when it jumps in and explores the box. Then, treat it every time you see it relieving itself in the box. If it starts relieving itself in a new spot instead, move the litter box there (or get a second box if you can fit it). Eventually your guinea pig might start to see the box as its toilet. Exercise Regular exercise is essential for guinea pigs to help prevent obesity and other health issues. Playing with your guinea pig in a secure area outside of the enclosure for a few hours per day will help it get both physical activity and mental stimulation. Plus, within the enclosure it can be helpful to place the sleeping area on one side and the food on another, so your guinea pig has to get up and move around. Selecting an enclosure with a second level accessible via a ramp (with a solid floor, not wires) also can encourage physical activity. Grooming As part of their care, guinea pigs need regular grooming at least weekly (or more often for longhaired guinea pigs). Brush out any mats and loose fur with a small, stiff brush or comb. Also, aim to clip your guinea pig's nails once every two weeks, or they can become overgrown and affect the animal's ability to walk.5 Your vet can show you how to do a nail trim if necessary. Upkeep Costs On a monthly basis, your main costs for a guinea pig will be its food and bedding. You’ll periodically have to replace nests and toys. And be sure to budget for an annual veterinary checkup as well as emergency medical care. Pros & Cons of Keeping a Guinea Pig as a Pet Guinea pigs are mostly quiet pets that don’t take up a lot of space. They’re also quite entertaining, and some can be very friendly and cuddly. However, they are social animals, and it’s ideal to keep more than one at a time, which adds to both their cost and upkeep. Plus, they are prone to some health problems and require a vet who specializes in guinea pigs. Purchasing or Adopting Your Guinea Pig Pet stores are a common source for pet guinea pigs. However, you're better off going to a reputable breeder or rescue organization, which typically will be able to give you more detailed information on the animal's origin, health, and temperament. Plus, good breeders and rescues tend to handle their guinea pigs regularly, which helps to keep them tame. Make sure any seller houses male and female guinea pigs separately, or there could be a chance you'll take home a pregnant female. Reproduction/Breeding Local exotic veterinarians might be able to point you in the direction of a good guinea pig breeder or rescue. The main benefit of a breeder is it will typically have a wider selection of animals or a particular variety you’re looking for. Look for a guinea pig that is active, alert, and in good body condition. If the seller says it's tame, then ask to handle it. The guinea pig should relax fairly quickly when you hold it. To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, keep multiple guinea pigs in same-sex groups. Some vets also will spay and neuter guinea pigs. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/rodents", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/training", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/exercise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/health", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/littering"]}
