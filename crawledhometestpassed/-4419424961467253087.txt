The favorable size for a pet snake is no more than 8-10 feet. Longer snakes require a much larger enclosure. For a medium-sized snake, an enclosure of about 20 gallons is adequate. While bulkier pet snakes such as boas and pythons can't live in smaller aquariums and need larger homes ranging up to 100 gallons or more in volume. Substrate As snakes in the wild adore their underground lifestyle, it is no brainer that they tend to burrow themselves while they live in captivity. Since most of the pet snakes have wild predecessors, their burrowing hunger can be only quenched by putting adequate substrate inside their enclosures. The substrate can be a newspaper/ soil or sand. The bottom of their enclosure can be lined with dry leaves, the bark of trees, and brown grass to give a natural touch. The quantity or thickness of substrate depends upon the snake. Some snakes require a substrate that is only an inch thick, while others like it more than several inches to give them a calm and secure feel. Mini Pool Being excellent swimmers in the wild, the majority of snakes are water-loving. As established, an ideal enclosure must emulate the exact natural habitats. Unfortunately, a swimming pool of some sort is nearly impossible inside an enclosure. But to prevent any malaise to the pet, it is advised to place a small water bowl or a mini pool inside the enclosure. The water must be drained, and the pool must be cleaned regularly. The temperature of the water must also be monitored and should be kept between 70–90 degrees Fahrenheit. The water natatorium not only refreshes the mood of the snake but also helps in thermoregulation. Monitor Temperature and Humidity Thermoregulation is vital to the survival of the snakes. They are cold-blooded reptiles that mainly get and dissipate heat into and from the environment. The optimum temperature for the majority of pet snakes is 75–85 degrees Fahrenheit. The substrate of the enclosure is essential in regulating the temperature of these reptiles' bodies. But one of the most important things in temperature maintenance is the water inside the enclosure. Thermoregulation for snakes is a complex phenomenon and requires a correct balance between the atmospheric, soil, and water temperatures to keep the metabolism of the snake on track. Humidity is another aspect that must be kept in mind. Although the ideal value is different for every species, a value of around 60% is suitable for most snakes. A water bowl inside the enclosure is vital in maintaining the mugginess. For ventilation, fans are installed to keep the air in circulation. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/snake", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/shelter"]}
