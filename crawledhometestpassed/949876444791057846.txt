It occurs when an untreated infection spreads and affects the jaw bone. Causes Stomatitis may be caused by poor animal husbandry, poor nutrition, and bacterial infection. It could also be caused by improper phosphorus and calcium levels, deficiency in Vitamin C, poor temperature regulation, and overcrowding. Physical causes include a trauma in the mouth due to a scratch or wound. Signs Early signs of this disease include a gum line stained with a brownish yellow matter which surrounds the periphery of the gums and teeth. Your chameleon may also have an occasional dehydrated film-like matter situated on the periphery of the mouth, and a slight swelling of the lower jaw. Loss of appetite may also ensue If the infection is not treated on time. Prevention Prevention practices include adequate monitoring of your chameleon for changes in gait, appetite, and level of activity. Also, keep the temperature at an optimum level as preferred by the species. Your chameleon’s cage should also be adequately ventilated with a relative humidity level of about 50 to 75 percent. Feed your chameleon with a variety of insects, and ensure you dust the insects with calcium and vitamin powders. As earlier stated, prevention all boils down to a better husbandry and prevention of bacterial infections. Treatment The major treatment course involves the use of antibiotics injections. The vet may also prescribe the application of an antibacterial solution on the affected area for a determined period of time. The temperature and other factors need to be adequately monitored during treatment. Your chameleon may not be able to adequately feed on its own, so you may need to feed it with your hands. If the condition is severe or there is little response to treatment, your chameleon will have to undergo a surgical removal of the infected bone or teeth. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/chameleon", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
