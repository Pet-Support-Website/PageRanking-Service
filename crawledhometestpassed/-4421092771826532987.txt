Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options. Medicines and Poisons Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435. Spaying and Neutering Female dogs should be spayed, and male dogs neutered by six months of age. Vaccinations Understanding Vaccines Vaccines help prepare the body's immune system to fight the invasion of disease-causing organisms. Vaccines contain antigens, which look like the disease-causing organism to the immune system but don't actually cause disease. When the vaccine is introduced to the body, the immune system is mildly stimulated. If a pet is ever exposed to the real disease, his immune system is now prepared to recognize and fight it off entirely or reduce the severity of the illness. Core Vaccines Core vaccines are considered vital to all pets based on risk of exposure, severity of disease or transmissibility to humans. Vaccines for canine parvovirus, distemper, canine hepatitis and rabies are considered core vaccines. Non-core vaccines are given depending on the dog’s exposure risk. These include vaccines against Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi and Leptospira bacteria. Determining the Timing and Frequency of Vaccinations Your veterinarian can best determine a vaccination schedule for your pet. This will depend on the type of vaccine, your pet’s age, medical history, environment and lifestyle. For puppies: If his mother has a healthy immune system, a puppy will most likely receive antibodies in mother’s milk while nursing. Puppies should receive a series of vaccinations starting at six to eight weeks of age. A veterinarian should administer a minimum of three vaccinations at three- to four-week intervals. The final dose should be administered at 16 weeks of age. For adult dogs: Some adult dogs might receive certain vaccines annually, while other vaccines might be given every three years or longer. Risks Associated with Vaccination Immunizations should mildly stimulate the animal’s immune system in order to create protection from specific infectious diseases. This stimulation can create mild symptoms, ranging from soreness at the injection site to fever and allergic reactions. The Scoop on Poop Keep your dog on a leash when you are outside, unless you are in a secure, fenced-in area. If your dog defecates on a neighbor's lawn, the sidewalk, or any other public place, please clean it up. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/dog", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/health", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/vaccination", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/littering"]}
