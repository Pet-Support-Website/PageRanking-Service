Some of the diseases that are common to danio fish include: Mycobacteriosis Mycobacteriosis is a disease caused by various species of mycobacteria. This disease inflames the organs of danios, leading to a change in skin pigment, a loss of scales, and weight loss. Treat mycobacteriosis with antibiotics. Prevent bacterial contamination by regularly cleaning the tank, and quarantine affected fish to prevent the disease from spreading. Velvet Velvet is caused by a pathogen called oodinium. Danios infected by this pathogen will display yellowish dust substances on their bodies. Other symptoms of velvet are loss of appetite, weight loss, and scratching against objects in the fish tank. The fish’s skin will eventually start to peel off. To treat velvet, dim the lights in the tank for several days and add aquarium salt to the water. Raise the water temperature to 82°F to speed up the life cycle of the pathogen. Ich Ich, or ichthyophthirius multifiliis, is one of the most common aquarium diseases, affecting most species of fish. This disease is caused by protozoan parasites and is characterized by white spots on fins, gills, and the body of the fish. A fish with ich will scratch against the walls of the tank. Other symptoms of ich include a loss of appetite and weight loss. To treat ich, increase the water temperature by a couple of degrees and use anti-parasitic medication. Swim Bladder Disorder Swim bladder disorder affects the functioning of the danio’s swim bladder. Fish need the right amount of air in the swim bladder to move upward and downward. A fish with swim bladder disorder will swim awkwardly, sometimes swimming upside-down. Swim bladder is caused by poor water quality or a sudden temperature change. Parasitic and bacterial infections can also cause the stomach to swell. Treat swim bladder by maintaining a water temperature of 78–80°F and not feeding the affected fish for three days. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/fish", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/danio", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
