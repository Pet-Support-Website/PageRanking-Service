Fruits (berries, melon, kiwi, etc.) can be a smaller part of the diet. Calcium and vitamin D3 supplements should be sprinkled on the food a few times each week. Tropical species benefit from a small amount of animal protein, such as a frozen pinkie mouse once a month for Red-Footed tortoises or earthworms for Yellow-Footed and Elongated tortoises. Commercial tortoise pellets can be fed occasionally, also providing additional animal protein. Here are some foods that are safe for tortoises to eat: •\tAlfalfa •\tAloe Vera •\tParsley •\tApples (no seeds) •\tBeets •\tSpinach •\tBanana •\tSquash •\tBroccoli •\tSummer Squash •\tBell Peppers •\tCantaloupe •\tGreen Beans •\tBrussel Sprouts •\tCarrots, chopped •\tKale •\tChard Chicory •\tCorn •\tPeaches •\tCollard •\tGreens Escarole •\tStrawberries •\tEggplant •\tGrape Leaves •\tZucchini •\tBananas •\tHibiscus © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/tortoise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/nutrient"]}
