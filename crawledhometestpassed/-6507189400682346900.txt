Place a litter box that your rabbit can easily hop in and out of inside the rabbit’s enclosure where it’s already been relieving itself. Also make sure your rabbit always has access to a box when it’s outside its enclosure. It’s best to limit its out-of-cage area (such as to a puppy play pen) until the rabbit has learned to use a litter box. That way, it shouldn’t ever be far from a box when it must relieve itself. Besides the litter, put a handful of hay in the box, which should entice your rabbit to go in. Replace the hay daily to keep it sanitary and replace the litter every couple of days. If the box becomes too dirty, the rabbit is likely not to want to use it. Furthermore, rabbits that aren’t spayed or neutered are more likely to relieve themselves outside of the litter box to mark their territory.7 Exercise Getting several hours of exercise per day is essential to keep a rabbit happy and to prevent health issues, such as obesity. Let your rabbit out of its enclosure as much as possible to allow it to roam in a safe area, as long as you're able to supervise. A minimum of four hours outside of the enclosure per day is ideal. To encourage activity, offer toys such as a tunnel for exploration or a treat ball. Reproduction/Breeding Local exotic animal veterinarians might be able to recommend a good breeder or rescue organization for you. The main benefit of a breeder is you’ll likely have a wider selection of younger animals and rarer breeds. However, don’t write off older rescue rabbits. You’ll be able to get a good sense of an older rabbit’s personality right away, and they’re often already tame around people and even litter trained. To avoid becoming an accidental breeder yourself if you’ll be bringing home multiple rabbits, discuss spaying or neutering with your vet. Common Health Problems Rabbits are prone to certain medical problems, such as: •\tDigestive issues, including blockages and diarrhea •\tEye problems, such as corneal ulcers •\tRespiratory infections •\tSkin issues, such as mites and ﬂeas Some rabbits also might experience overgrown teeth. Rabbit teeth continuously grow and need to be worn down via their diet and chew toys. Overgrown teeth can make it difficult for a rabbit to eat and drink and typically must be trimmed by a vet. Tip Not all veterinarians accept rabbits as patients. So before acquiring a pet rabbit, make sure there is a vet near you who will be able to treat it. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/rabbit", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/training", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/exercise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/health", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/littering"]}
