The captive tortoises mainly suffer due to this disease. Causes •\tLow humidity •\tCongested enclosure •\tInactive lifestyle •\tOverfeeding protein •\tDiet with calcium-phosphorus imbalance •\tDehydration •\tLack of UV Symptoms •\tUpward, bumpy growth of individual scutes •\tParalysis •\tWeakness •\tAbnormal movement Treatments & Prevention Of course, the pyramiding treatment should start with getting back on a healthy meal plan and feeding schedule. Then, add fiber-rich items to the diet of the tortoises. Next, make sure the UV light in the enclosure is working correctly. While the UVA influences the activity of the tortoises, the UVB promotes shell and bone growth. Later, focus on the humidity and temperature range in the habitat. Experts suggest keeping the humidity percentage around 80. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/tortoise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
