This condition occurs when bacteria and toxins proliferate in the bloodstream and organs, quickly leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. Snakes with septicemia are critically ill and close to death. Signs of Septicemia •Lethargy •Difficulty breathing •Weakness •Inability to move •Loss of muscle control •Seizures •Death Causes Bacteria can enter the bloodstream through localized infection, traumatic injury, or even parasite infestations. This is often due to poor husbandry practices and snakes that are kept in unsanitary enclosures, are fed improperly, do not have appropriate temperature and humidity levels, or are under significant stress are more susceptible to septicemia. Diagnosis Septicemia can be diagnosed through a physical exam and blood work completed by the veterinary staff. Once diagnosed, prompt treatment is necessary to save the snake’s life.
