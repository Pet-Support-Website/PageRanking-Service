But of course, it is hard to recognize the condition as we do not keep any fecal journals for pets. However, the tortoises will drop signs if they are not pooping regularly. See, though a tortoise eats regularly, it does not release waste as frequently as other animals. Instead, the pet will take a dump when you soak it in warm water. Generally, a healthy tortoise poops every 2 – 3 days. The tortoise is constipated if it does not release its waste after this period. Causes •\tDehydration •\tParasite •\tForeign object ingestion •\tBladder stone •\tEgg binding in gravid tortoises •\tPoor quality diet Symptoms •\tAppetite loss •\tLethargy •\tTrauma •\tStress •\tSunken eyes •\tFlaky skin A condition similar to constipation is fecal impaction. The tortoises refuse to poop in that condition too. But the impaction is more severe and requires surgery. Treatment Some changes in the lifestyle can influence the bowel movement of the tortoise. For example, Soaking In Warm Water: As I have mentioned, tortoises only take a dump when soaked. So, make regular arrangements for bathing the tortoises. Again, tortoises tend to drink water when bathing, which also solves the dehydration issue. One more thing. You need lukewarm water to soak your tortoise. This creature is not a big fan of cold water and may walk out of the pool if the temperature is not right. Moreover, a warm temperature is also necessary to encourage the tortoise to urinate or release feces. Work On The Diet: A poor diet is another reason for constipation in tortoises. Hence, the owners have to research first before making the meal plan for the pets. Adding fiber-rich content to the diet is mandatory. Laxatives: In severe conditions, the vets suggest laxatives that soften the stool and encourage the tortoise to poop. Though there are synthetic laxatives available, natural alternatives are always recommended. Bananas and pumpkins are two popular laxatives for tortoises. Maintain A Suitable Temperature: Tortoises are cold-blooded animals and require external heat to function correctly. Hence, the drop in habitat temperature can mess up the tortoise’s digestive system. Therefore, you must ensure a suitable and warm environment inside the pet enclosure. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/tortoise", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
