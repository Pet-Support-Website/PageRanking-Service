While our regular pets make certain noises and gestures when hungry, snakes exhibit no such phenomenon, mostly remaining quiet and solitary. As a result, snakes are often not fed often enough, and they try to escape the enclosure. This is a common reason that owners rehome or sell their pets—and it reinforces the stigma that \"snakes can't become pets.\" The point I am making is simple: Like other pets, snakes require regular feeding. I have simplified the feeding chart below for your ease. When to Feed and How Much While snakes do exhibit signs of hunger, they're often very mild and are easily skipped by beginners, giving a false sense that their pet is not hungry. Hunger signs generally observed by experienced keepers include hyperactivity and escape attempts, and a hungry snake may even be driven to latch onto anything that comes within its radius. Feeding times vary by the kind of snake you have, their size and age, and many other variables such as shedding and breeding. Consult a vet and do your research to know what your particular pet's needs are. As a general rule of thumb, you must feed your snake once or twice a week. For some species, once a month is okay. By keeping a close eye on the quantity of the feed and the time taken by the pet to digest, you can crack the exact feeding pattern that suits your pet. It's a time-consuming process and requires detailed observation of signs and activities shown by the snake. What to Feed Anything that is fed to the snake must not be larger than the mouth of the snake to avoid any problem in swallowing. In contrast to natural conditions, pet snakes in captivity are not fed live animals/rodents; live rodents can seriously harm your pet, which may result in life-threatening infections. To avoid any serious complications, pet owners are advised to give their pets thawed mice/chicken. But freezing and thawing of already dead rodents will result in the growth of pathogenic bacteria. These pathogenic bacteria cause food poisoning in digestive issues. So, the owners are strongly cautioned in the case of spoiled or contaminated food. Cost of the Feed At present, the market is really small, and no company specializes in making snake food. But you can buy frozen rodents and amphibians from certain vendors and pet shops. Although the feed is cheap, the quality is something to keep in mind. A frozen medium-sized mouse can cost $5-20. Considering the rule of feeding once a week, a months’ worth of food will cost roughly $20-80. That is a broad range, but you should have a budget of around $60 to keep your pet satisfied. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/snake", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/nutrient"]}
