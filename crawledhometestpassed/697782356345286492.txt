These infectious agents could be bacteria, worms, flagellates, mites. Specific examples of the most commonly occurring parasites include cryptosporidium, nematodes, trematodes, and protozoa. Causes There are two major causes of parasitic infections in chameleons. One is when they are constantly fed wild insects and the other is a general lack of hygienic conditions. Wild insects are prone to various infections and these could be transferred to your chameleon when they eat them. Signs The signs of intestinal worm infections include a swollen belly, general weakness, and emaciation. Signs of infection with bacteria or protozoans include diarrhea, slimy feces, loss of weight, dehydration, loss of appetite, and feces with bad smell. Prevention Since the eradication of some protozoans could prove to be very difficult, it is best to prevent parasitic infections. This can be done by giving them insects which are healthy and not caught from the wild. In addition, there should be adherence to strict enclosure hygiene. Extra preventive measures that can be put in place include checking the fresh feces of your chameleon periodically. This will be done by a vet who will help you prepare a sample and view it under the microscope. This can help you detect parasites or infections very early. Also, examine the body of your chameleon to remove “black dots” which may be mites and disinfect the cage periodically. See more: How Often Should I Clean a Chameleon Cage? (Clean Guide) Treatment The diagnosis and treatment of this condition are usually left for the vet. However, if your chameleon is being infested with mites, you can treat it by sterilizing the entire enclosure of your chameleon. Hot water, steam or ammonium solution can be used to sterilize the enclosure. If there are mites on the body of your chameleon, you can remove it with a moist Q-tip. After a month, examine the enclosure to ensure that all the mites are gone. If they still persist, carry out the sterilization process all over again. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/chameleon", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/diseases"]}
