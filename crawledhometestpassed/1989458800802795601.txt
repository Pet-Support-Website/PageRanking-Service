They can also change color when they're stressed or happy. Caring for a chameleon requires proper natural habitats meaning big cages to accommodate their need to climb, privacy, and various temperatures throughout its home. Additionally, they need a gut-loaded and calcium supplemented diet. This beautiful creature may be the pet for you if you're willing to make the commitment to properly care for it. WARNING Being territorial and solitary animals, chameleons should be kept by themselves; males are especially aggressive toward one another. Behavior and Temperament Young chameleons are usually a dull gray/brown color and can change shades a bit. At around five months of age, the adult color and the ability to change colors develop, and a range of colors—including green, blue-green, turquoise, and black—can be seen. Changing colors provide camouflage, temperature regulation, and a means of communicating with other chameleons. Similar to anoles, chameleons change colors in response to excitement, stress, temperature, lighting conditions, the presence of another chameleon, and other influences. Generally, a dark brown to black chameleon is stressed, with the brighter colors reflecting a happier mood. Chameleons use their tongues to catch prey. A chameleon's tongue can be up to 1.5 times the length of its body, allowing chameleons to catch insects from a distance. They primarily eat insects, but some will eat vegetation and small invertebrates. Chameleon feet have three toes pointing in one direction and two that point the opposite way, which gives them a good grip on the tree branches they spend most of their time on. Many species also have prehensile tails. They have globular eyes that rotate like turrets and move independently, allowing them to scan a wide radius to hunt for food and look out for predators. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/reptile", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/chameleon", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general"]}
