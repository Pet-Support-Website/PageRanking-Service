Many pet shop cages marketed for guinea pigs are too small. Remember their cage is their primary space for exercise unless you're able to take your pet out and monitor it for most of the day. One of the best options is a cage with a plastic base and wire top, which allows for good airflow. One guinea pig should have a cage that is at least 30 inches by 36 inches. For two guinea pigs, get a cage that's at least 30 inches by 50 inches. A height of around 18 inches is fine. The floor space is more important than the height, as guinea pigs generally don’t climb. In the cage, add a small animal hideout or nest, which you can find at most pet stores, where your guinea pig can go to feel secure and rest. And add some guinea pig toys for chewing and play, which also are available at most pet stores. Place the cage in a quiet part of your home. Loud noises and sudden movements can easily stress a guinea pig. Also, make sure the cage is out of direct sunlight and away from drafts. Specific Substrate Needs Always use a cage with a solid bottom and not a wire grate, as this can damage the feet of a guinea pig. Add a 2-inch layer of paper bedding at the bottom. Avoid cedar and pine bedding, which can irritate a guinea pigs respiratory system. © 2023 Pet Support Reserved for senior project only.", "url_lists": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/rodents", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/general", "http://localhost:3000/searchTags/shelter"]}
